## Requirements

## Setup

During setup few things will happen:

1. Basic information about about project in `package.json` will changed:

- `version` will be set to `0.0.0-development`(for automatic release with [sematic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release))
- `name` set to developer's value
- `description` set to developer's value
- `author` set to developer's value
- `homepage` set to developer's value
- `bugs` set to developer's value
- `license` set to developer's value

2. All entries from `CHANGELOG.md` will erased.
3. `LICENSE` will be erased.
4. Documentation will be updated to use new package details.
